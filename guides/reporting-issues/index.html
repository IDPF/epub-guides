			<p>This document outlines the process for requesting and making changes to any of the <a
					href="https://github.com/IDPF">IDPF's GitHub repositories</a>.</p>

			<p>A free <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> is required in order to perform the operations
				described in this document.</p>

			<p>This document is not a tutorial on how to use the git version control system. If you are unfamiliar with
				forking/cloning repositories, committing changes, creating pull requests or performing other operations,
				please first take the time to review the <a href="https://help.github.com/">GitHub documentation</a>.</p>

		<section id="sec-reporting" class="chapter">
			<h1 class="title">2. Reporting Issues</h1>

			<p>The easiest way to request a change is to report an issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible
				to assist in reviewing your request (e.g., affected document and section and rationale for the change).</p>

			<p>If you are not familiar with opening GitHub issues, the following steps will guide you through the
				process:</p>

			<ul class="body">
				<li><a href="https://github.com/IDPF/">Locate the IDPF repository</a> that contains the document you want
					changed. If you are unsure which your issue applies to, use the <a
						href="https://github.com/IDPF/epub-revision">EPUB revision repository</a>.</li>
				<li>Click on the "Issues" tab.</li>
				<li>Check the open issues and/or try some keyword searches to verify that the issue has not already been
					reported.</li>
				<li>Click on the "New issue" button.</li>
				<li>Create a short title that meaningfully conveys the issue.</li>
				<li>Write a detailed description of the issue, include a proposed resolution if you have one.</li>
				<li>Click submit.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Note that you may not receive feedback right away, but that does not mean the issue will not be, or is not
				being, considered. See the <a href="#sec-evaluation">section on evaluation</a> below for more information on
				why an issue can take a while to get addressed.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-pull-requests" class="chapter">
			<h1 class="title">3. Creating Pull Requests</h1>

			<p>GitHub allows users to copy public repositories, make changes to the source markup and submit the changed
				documents back for consideration. The process of submitting the changed document(s) back is called making a
				pull request (i.e., asking the owner to pull the changes back in).</p>

			<p>Although the EPUB Working Group will review all requests and make any necessary changes, users can submit pull
				requests with their issues.</p>

			<p>Pull requests are most helpful for new additions (e.g., to add a new item to a registry), especially when the
				request is for a change that the Working Group might not be as familiar with. Creating a pull request does
				not guarantee the request will be considered any faster, but will expedite the update process.</p>

			<p>Pull requests are best done by advanced git users. The process involves forking the applicable IDPF
				repository, downloading a local copy, updating the affected file(s), committing the changes back to your fork
				and then creating a pull request in the EPUB repository.</p>

			<p>For more detailed instructions about this process, please refer to the following GitHub documentation
				pages:</p>

			<ul class="body">
				<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/">Working with forks</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/">Creating a pull request
						from a fork</a></li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-evaluation" class="chapter">
			<h1 class="title">4. Evaluation of Requests</h1>

			<p>The EPUB working group is responsible for evaluating and approving request changes to the EPUB format. Other
				working groups may be responsible for the various modular specifications that have been developed by the
				IDPF.</p>

			<p>Change requests are typically screened by the applicable working group Chairs prior to bringing to the full
				working group for review and approval. Issues can be closed without broader review if they are determined to
				be out of scope, inapplicable, infeasiable or otherwise unimplementable.</p>

			<p>The IDPF cannot guarantee a timeline for review and approval of change requests. Some changes can only be made
				during revisions to the EPUB specifications, regardless of their merit (the IDPF will issue errata between
				revisions for serious technical issues). Others, such as additions to registries, may be implemented quickly
				if a key need is recognized.</p>

			<p>Depending on the nature of the change requested, approval of the IDPF Board and full membership may also be
				necessary (e.g., for feature request changes to the EPUB format).</p>

			<p>Note that the approval process described in this section does not apply to every repository that the IDPF
				maintains. For example, some repositories are created for use by subgroups developing new specifications, and
				those groups have discretion over how they address changes. Similarly, repositories that host guides, samples
				and other informative documents do not necessarily require a full review of every change request. The IDPF
				has sole discretion over how its repositories are run.</p>
