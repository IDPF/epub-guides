			<h1 class="title">1. Overview</h1>

			<p>This document provides answers to commonly asked questions about the <a
					href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/latest/accessibility">EPUB Accessibility</a> specification and its <a
					href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/latest/accessibility/techniques">associated techniques</a>. It provides
				guidance and insight into how the document was created and the reasons for various choices in
				implementation.</p>

			<p>The document is not intended as a how-to guide to creating accessible content. Please use the <a
					href="http://www.idpf.org/forums/accessibility">IDPF Accessibility forum</a> to ask questions about how
				to implement the requirements.</p>
		</section>

			<h1 class="title">2. Discovery Metadata</h1>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">2.1 Why was schema.org metadata chosen?</h2>
				<p>Schema.org metadata is required in the package document because it provides a comprehensive set of
					descriptive metadata that fits the EPUB metadata model.</p>
				<p>As EPUB continues to integrate with the Open Web Platform — where schema.org metadata is used by the major
					search engines when cataloguing information — it also represents a stable fit for future versions of the
					standard.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">2.2 Why is ONIX not required for discovery metadata?</h2>
				<p>Although ONIX is critical metadata in ebook distribution channels, EPUB publications are not necessarily
					books nor are they all distributed through the major ebook channels. Requiring all authors of EPUB
					content to include an ONIX record would greatly complicate EPUB production, and could make compliance
					unfeasible for many.</p>
				<p>The choice of schema.org metadata in the package document does not diminish the need for rich
					accessibility metadata in ONIX records, and there is a requirement to include accessibility metadata in
					any distribution records that accompany an EPUB publication.</p>
				<p>The accessibility group is looking to work with the various metadata authorities to harmonize their
					accessibility vocabularies as a future objective so that the same information can be encoded across
					formats.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">2.3 Can I call my discoverable publication accessible?</h2>
				<p>If your publication only includes discoverability metadata and does not meet the accessibility
					requirements of the specification, it must not be promoted as accessible.</p>
				<p>Meeting the discovery requirements allows Users to determine whether the content will be usable by them,
					but is not in itself an achievement that they need to be made aware of.</p>
			</section>

		<section class="chapter">
			<h1 class="title">3. Accessibility Conformance</h1>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">3.1 What if I cannot meet all these requirements?</h2>
				<p>Changing production practices is never easy, but there also needs to be a clear benchmark to meet to begin
					making progress. The EPUB working group understands that the ability to meet these requirements is going
					to vary depending on the nature of the content produced and how it is produced.</p>
				<p>The working group has also structured the specification to soften the move as much as possible, without
					compromising the usability of the content. The specification only requires WCAG 2.0 Level A conformance,
					for example, even though many regulatory frameworks require Level AA conformance for web content
					(publishers already have to meet the higher level in such jurisdictions). Conformance is also not
					mandatory for an EPUB publication to be valid, so that accessibility does not become a barrier to
					distribution while publishers are improving their processes.</p>
				<p>The working group could not lower the threshold below WCAG conformance, as trying to pick and choose rules
					to follow would lead to content that is only accessible to certain audiences, and certifying who those
					audiences would be a complex undertaking.</p>
				<p>The issue with raising production quality is why the discovery metadata is so important to include. A
					publisher may not be able to state their content fully conforms to the specification, but if the work
					that has been done can be surfaced then users can make the decision for themselves about whether it will
					still meet their needs.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">3.2 Why are there guidelines for only some HTML elements in the techniques?</h2>
				<p>The techniques document does not duplicate the requirements of WCAG 2.0. It only addresses situations
					where the guidance differs for publications, or where no guidance exists.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">3.3 What if there is another way to make content accessible that is not listed?</h2>
				<p>The techniques documents for both the EPUB Accessibility specification and WCAG 2.0 are advisory in
					nature. New techniques are always being developed to handle new situations. If a new technique provides
					the same level of accessibility, it is acceptable to use it.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">3.4 Is there a checklist of requirements?</h2>
				<p>The techniques do not include a checklist, as the requirement for conformance will vary from publication
					to publication (e.g., depending on the type of content included).</p>
				<p>A validation process document is currently under development that will guide in checking the requirements
					for conformance. In addition, software is being developed to assist in the process. It is expected that
					the validation process and the software when used together will still require human intelligence for
					certain tests.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">3.5 Why is the conformance metadata a URL?</h2>
				<p>The <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/#sec-conf-reporting">a11y:conformsTo property</a> takes a URL
					so that the conformance statement is always the same and can be easily checked by machine (e.g., for
					validation, ingestion into a distribution system, etc.).</p>
				<p>A human-readable statement about conformance should be included in the <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/techniques/#sec-meta-005">schema:accessibilitySummary
						property</a>. The EPUB Accessibility specification does not require wording for such statements.</p>
			</section>

		<section class="chapter">
			<h1 class="title">4. Optimized Publications</h1>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">4.1 Why identify optimizations?</h2>
				<p>The identification of optimizations ties into the importance of discovery metadata. Content that meets
					accessibility requirements for specific user groups needs to be discoverable by those groups, even if the
					content is not considered broadly accessible.</p>
				<p>Identifying the third-party standard the content conforms to gives users this missing context.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">4.2 Can I call my optimized publication accessible?</h2>
				<p>The EPUB Accessibility specification does not endorse optimizations; it only address how to identify them
					in the metadata.</p>
				<p>Any claims about the accessibility of an optimization must not make reference to the EPUB Accessibility
					specification or the IDPF. Such a claim should identify the standard the publication conforms to and the
					organization that created that standard.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">4.3 How do I identify an optimization standard?</h2>
				<p>Conformance to a third-party standard is indicated by including a link tag in the metadata with a URL that
					points to where the standard is defined.</p>
				<pre>&lt;link
   rel="a11y:conformsTo"
   href="http://www.daisy.org/guidelines/epub/navigable-audio-only-epub3-guidelines"/></pre>
				<p>The preceding example indicates that the publication conforms to DAISY guidelines for navigable audio-only
					publications.</p>
				<p>It is recommended to include a human-readable description of conformance in the <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/techniques/#sec-meta-005">schema:accessibilitySummary
						property</a>, as well.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">4.4 What is the optimized standards registry?</h2>
				<p>The IDPF maintains a <a href="http://idpf.github.io/epub-registries/optimizations/">registry of known
						optimization standards</a> to help facilitate lookup of their identifiers.</p>
				<p>This list is provided solely for informational purposes. The IDPF does not develop optimization standards
					and neither endorses nor discourages their use.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">4.5 Do I have to register my standard?</h2>
				<p>No, the registry is informative. The only requirement is that the standard the content conforms to be
					identified.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="section">
				<h2 class="title">4.6 How do I register my standard?</h2>
				<p>Inclusion of new standards can be requested by opening an issue in the <a
						href="https://github.com/IDPF/epub-registries">GitHub repository</a> (requires a GitHub account).
					Advanced GitHub users can also update the <a
						href="https://github.com/IDPF/epub-registries/blob/master/registries/optimizations/index.html"
						>registry page</a> directly and make a pull request.</p>
				<p>Requests should provide as much information as possible about the standard.</p>
